# Assets Directory

This directory contains the assets for the Company Chat App.

## Required Assets

To complete the setup, please add the following assets:

### Google Logo (Optional)
- File: `google_logo.png` 
- Description: Google's logo for the sign-in button
- Size: 24x24 pixels recommended
- You can download it from Google's brand guidelines or use the fallback icon

## Note

The app will work without these assets as it includes fallback icons. The Google logo will fallback to a login icon if not found.
